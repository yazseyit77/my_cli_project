# MyCliProject

Welcome to your my gem! 

This gem is a reflection of an online shopping application. I have a short list of products that I display for sale.

The list of products are scraped from an actual sales website.


## Installation

git clone https://github.com/yazseyit77/my_cli_project.git

cd my_cli_project


## Install dependencies

Using Bundler and Rake:

bundle && rake


## Usage

In the terminal, it will ask you to type your name and then it will list the products that we have. 

You can type the number of the product you are interested in on the terminalfor more details.

Type "list" to see the prduct list and/or type "exit" to quit the application.
